Elevated PSA levels may indicate prostate cancer, a noncancerous condition such as prostatitis, or an enlarged prostate.\n\npassage 3:1 Total PSA levels between 4.0 ng/ml and 10.0 ng/ml may indicate prostate cancer (about a 25% chance, according to the ACS), benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) , or inflammation of the prostate. 2  These conditions are more common in the elderly, as is a general increase in PSA levels.f the DRE is normal but the PSA is moderately elevated, a free PSA test may be used to look at the ratio of free to total PSA. This can help to distinguish between prostate cancer and other non-cancer causes of elevated PSA.\n\nIn case the passages do not contain the necessary information to answer the question, please reply with: \"Unable to answer based on given passages.\"\noutput:"}

Though our Chestnuts are quite sweet right out of the bag, due to our SECRET post harvest conditioning process, for best flavor you should dry them slightly. A unique aspect of Chestnuts is that they become sweeter as they dry.\n\npassage 2:Harvesting Chestnut Trees. After the chestnuts fall from the tree, watch for the spiny burs to split. Don\u2019t harvest chestnuts if the burs are still green and closed because the nuts inside will be unripe. Harvest the nuts every couple of days.\n\npassage 3:When to harvest chestnuts? Chestnuts don\u2019t ripen at the same time and chestnut harvest time can span as much as five weeks, although the nuts generally ripen in a 10- to 30-day span of time in late August and September. Allow the nuts to fall from the tree naturally.\n\nIn case the passages do not contain the necessary information to answer the question, please reply with: \"Unable to answer based on given passages.\"\noutput:"}

Plan on it taking twice the normal cooking time to reheat a fully frozen chicken dish.If the dish cannot be heated through to at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit in two hours, reduce the size of the chicken dish before initially placing it in the oven. Wrap the chicken tightly in heavy freezer paper for freezing. 2  Don't thaw raw chicken at room temperature or under warm water. 3  Instead, thaw it safely in the refrigerator so it never warms above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. 4  Raw, uncooked frozen chicken should not be cooked in any type of oven directly from its frozen state.\n\npassage 2:Reheating a takeout chicken can help bring back its just-from-the-oven juiciness -- if you do it right.

If you think a cold is coming on, make sure to supply your body with the nutrients it needs to stay healthy and fight off the virus. 1  Eat diverse fruits and vegetables to make sure you get the vitamins you need.\n\npassage 3:1. Drink plenty of warm fluids. Drinking warm fluids helps to loosen the secretions in your sinuses so that your mucus flows more freely, making you feel better faster. Studies show that drinking warm fluids relieves cold symptoms such as runny nose, cough, sneezing, sore throat, and fatigue. Start with one irrigation a day while you have symptoms. 2  As you feel better, you can increase it to twice daily. 3  Make a saline solution or buy one from the store. 4  To make your own solution, combine \u00bc tsp of kosher or pickling salt, \u00bc tsp of baking soda, and 8 ounces of warm distilled or boiled water.\n\nIn case the passages do not contain the necessary information to answer the question, please reply with: \"Unable to answer based on given passages.\"\noutput:"}

This measures the alkalinity or acidity of the soil, and helps to determine what pH your fertilizer should have. 3  3. Measure your lawn.\n\npassage 3:Pour in the rest of the fertilizer. Apply the rest of fertilizer in a perpendicular pattern. Step on the turf and if the leaf blade bounces back up, your lawn is in good shape. If it lays flat, you've over-fertilized.\n\nIn case the passages do not contain the necessary information to answer the question, please reply with: \"Unable to answer based on given passages.\"\noutput:"}

You can grill potatoes on either a gas or charcoal grill. Grilling potatoes uses dry heat, which qualifies them to be called baked potatoes. Because of the high heat of grills, you need to use both direct and indirect heat, cooking them with hotter and cooler cooking temperatures, respectively.\n\npassage 2:You can grill your potatoes without any foil, as the skin keeps the potatoes from sticking. Grilling without foil allows more smokiness from the grill to penetrate the potato. However, by wrapping your potatoes in foil you can use seasonings and oil during cooking, boosting crispiness and flavor.\n\npassage 3:Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat. Prepare four foil squares large enough to fold over one potato each. Spread butter onto foil in a large enough area that the potato will be completely covered when rolled up. Sprinkle salt, garlic, pepper, and Italian seasoning evenly over foil. Roll each potato in the foil; puncture the package (including the potato) with a fork or knife a few times. Grill for 1 hour, or until soft, turning the potatoes often. Serve with your favorite toppings.\n\nIn case the passages do not contain the necessary information to answer the question, please reply with: \"Unable to answer based on given passages.\"\noutput:"}

Commas customarily indicate a brief pause; they're not as final as periods. Rule 1. Use commas to separate words and word groups in a simple series of three or more items. Example: My estate goes to my husband, son, daughter-in-law, and nephew. Note: When the last comma in a series comes before and or or (after daughter-in-law in the above example), it is known as the Oxford comma.\n\npassage 2:Quick Guide to Commas. 1. Use commas to separate independent clauses when they are joined by any of these seven coordinating conjunctions: and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet. 2. Use commas after introductory a) clauses, b) phrases, or c) words that come before the main clause.\n\npassage 3:Rule 2. Use a comma to separate two adjectives when the order of the adjectives is interchangeable. Example: He is a strong, healthy man. We could also say healthy, strong man. Example: We stayed at an expensive summer resort. We would not say summer expensive resort, so no comma.\n\nIn case the passages do not contain the necessary information to answer the question, please reply with: \"Unable to answer based on given passages.\"\noutput:"}

Boil the egg for 10 seconds. Place the whole egg (still in the shell) in the boiling water for exactly 10 seconds. Remove the egg from the water, and lower the heat to bring the water to a simmer. Boiling the egg helps it to retain its shape once it's cracked and poured into simmering water later. 4. Poach the egg.\n\npassage 2:All it takes is three easy resources to make it happen \u2014 a pin, a timer, and 10 seconds. You'll need a pot of water, a slotted spoon, and eggs, of course, but it's the pin, timer, and extra few seconds that really make the magic happen. How To Make Julia Child's Poached Eggs. 1. Boil the water. Bring a pot of water to a boil. 2. Make a hole in the eggshell with the pin. Use a pin to make a small hole in the eggshell. This will release any air that's in the egg, which could otherwise cause it to crack.\n\npassage 3:Method 3 Using a silicon egg poacher cup. 1. If you have access to a good kitchen store, consider purchasing a small silicon egg poacher cup or a set of silicon egg poachers (a set often comes with a pan with a clear lid). This is a fairly inexpensive option and they're very easy to use.\n\nIn case the passages do not contain the necessary information to answer the question, please reply with: \"Unable to answer based on given passages.\"\noutput:"}
